# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-with-Minimax-and-Alpha-Beta-Pruning

This project is an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe game that demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used to make optimal decisions in a simple turn-based game. The AI opponent is powered by two classical decision-making algorithms:

Minimax Algorithm
Alpha-Beta Pruning (optimized Minimax)

The goal is to compare both algorithms in terms of performance and decision-making quality while also providing an interactive game environment that reflects how these strategies play out in real-time.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features
Fully functional 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game.

AI uses Minimax or Alpha-Beta Pruning to play optimally.
Performance benchmarking to compare both algorithms.
Simple command-line interface for game visualization and interaction.
Written in Python with clean, modular code structure.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Project
This project was developed to explore fundamental AI algorithms used in turn-based games and to visualize their behavior and efficiency. It serves as a practical implementation for learning game theory, recursive algorithms, and optimization techniques.
